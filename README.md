# [Options Checker](#)

[Options Checker](#) is a basic options checking site that returns a history chart of user inputted company ticker, strike, option type and expiration date using data from [Yahoo! Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/). Although this site is redundant compared to the existing Yahoo! Finance method of searching for contracts, some users may find it faster to manually input values rather than scrolling and clicking.
